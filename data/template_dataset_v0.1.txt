Multithreading benchmarking program
This program consists of two tests. In the first test
two threads are created,
which continously signal/wait each other. This forces
alternate between the two threads, and gives a measure
synchronization granularity. In the second test, the
main thread is repeatedly
put to sleep for a very short interval using glfwSleep.
The average sleep time
is measured, which tells the minimum supported sleep

(4) Delete letters from the dictionry word   - (password -> pssword)
(5) Collection of other rules you might like - (password -> drowssap)
(7) Save your rule
(8) Cancel and go back to the previous menu (WARNING WILL NOT SAVE YOUR RULE!)
(9) Help and general thoughts on rule creation, (if I get around to writing this)
(Q) How do I add two digits to the end of a dictionary word?
(A) If you want to add all digits, aka 00-99 then simply make two rules
--Add a digit to the end of the dictionary word
(Q) What if I want to only add certain numbers like dates?
(A) This is a little bit harder, and unless I add support for it, will probably require several different rules
For example if you want to add support for 1900-1999 and 2000-2009 you could create two rules
In future versions I'll see what I can do to make this easier since dates are very commonly used in passwords
(Q) What are the most common word mangling rules that I should include?
(A) That really depends on if a password policy exists or not
If no password policy is being used, first make sure you have a NOOP rule, (included by default so it's there if you haven't deleted it)
Also, it's a good idea to always add the lowercase sub-rule first, even if you want to try upper case letters
This is because some input dictionaries vary on if the first letter is stored as uppercase or not
You should have a rule that adds 1 digit to the end, and another rule that adds two digits to the end.  These are the most common passwords
If a letter is going to be capitalized, it will almost always be the first letter
Discarding frame, not EAP Identification or EAP-MD5.
www.shmoocon.org  <-Yes, that is a bit of blatent self promotion.  It's not like I'm being paid, so I might as well pump up my ego instead
(4) Go back to the previous menu
Please enter which position you want to insert the string.  Note, if the position is longer than the word, it will not be inserted
The numbering starts at 0, and the maxvalue is 35
Bug alert! If you are inserting more than one character, please do it in reverse.  I might fix this in the next version
Aka if you want to insert '123' then type '321'.  This is because it inserts each char individual into the position you specified
Please type in the value you want to insert.
If you want to use one of the built in character list ranges, type the following
You can also create your own list by putting the values between '[' ']', such as [aeiouy] to insert a vowel
Example:[d][d]     <-will add two digits on to the end of the password, aka 'password99'
*If you want to insert a '\\', or a '[', or a ']', or a '-', please put a '\\' before it, aka '\\-'
<enter value to insert>:
(7) Toggle the case of a letter at a certain location -(password->pAssword)
(10) Go back to the previous menu
Please enter the character position, (0,1,2,3...N), you want to toggle
John the Ripper only supports a max character position of 35
--(I'll be honest, most of these rules except for duplicate are fairly worthless)----
(6) Pluralize, (lowercase only, only seems to add an s)   -(password->passwords)
(9) Go back to the previous menu
Please enter the character you want to replace, or just hit enter to go back to the previous menu
Please enter the character position, (0,1,2,3...N), you want to delete

Gamma correction error summary
The printed value is the maximum error in the pixel values
calculated by the libpng gamma correction code.  The error
is calculated as the difference between the output pixel
value (always an integer) and the ideal value from the
libpng specification (typically not an integer).
Expect this value to be less than .5 for 8 bit formats,
less than 1 for formats with fewer than 8 bits and a small
number (typically less than 5) for the 16 bit formats.
For performance reasons the value for 16 bit formats
increases when the image file includes an sBIT chunk.
Gamma correction with 16 to 8 bit reduction:
/* adler32, crc32, MD5[16], intent, date, length, file-name */
/* ERROR: stdin */

This program benchmarks the performance differences between
strcasecmp() and sm_strcasecmp().
These tests may take several minutes to complete.
If you want to run it, specify -d as option.
** results too close: no decision
Interpreting the results:
For differences larger than 2 seconds, the lower value is
better and that function should be used for performance
reasons.
This program will re-run the tests when the difference is
less than 2 seconds.
The result will vary depending on the compiler optimization
level used. Compiling the sendmail libsm library with a
better optimization level can change the results.
strlcpy() and sm_strlcpy(), and strlcat() and sm_strlcat().
versions of strlcpy(3) and strlcat(3). Thus, performing
these tests will not be of much use.
If your OS has strlcpy(3) and strlcat(3) then set the macro
SM_CONF_STRL to 1 in your site.config.m4 file
(located in ../devtools/Site) and recompile this program.
Test 1: strlcat() versus sm_strlcat()
Test 2: strlcpy() versus sm_strlpy()
This test takes about 8 seconds.
If it takes longer than 30 seconds, please interrupt it
and compile again without semaphore support, i.e.,
No support for semaphores configured on this machine
add -DSM_CONF_SHM=0 to confENVDEF in devtools/Site/site.config.m4and start over.

Queries the DNS for information.
The hostname is looked up for IP4, IP6 and mail.
If an ip-address is given a reverse lookup is done.
Use the -v option to see DNSSEC security information.
-t type		what type to look for.
-c class		what class to look for, if not class IN.
-y 'keystring'	specify trust anchor, DS or DNSKEY, like
-y 'example.com DS 31560 5 1 1CFED8478...'
-D			DNSSEC enable with default root anchor
-f keyfile		read trust anchors from file, with lines as -y.
-F keyfile		read named.conf-style trust anchors.
-C config		use the specified unbound.conf (none read by default)
pass as first argument if you want to override some
options with further arguments
-r			read forwarder information from /etc/resolv.conf
-v			be more verbose, shows nodata and security.
-d			debug, traces the action, -d -d shows more.
-4			use ipv4 network, avoid ipv6.
-6			use ipv6 network, avoid ipv4.
-h			show this usage help.

Congratulations, you have saved the Federation

Well, you ran into something and the game is over.
Move or shoot? (m-s)
*rustle* *rustle* (must be bats nearby)
*whoosh* (I feel a draft from some pits).
*sniff* (I can smell the evil Wumpus nearby!)
Sorry, but we're constrained to a semi-Euclidean cave!
What?  The cave isn't that big!
To which room do you wish to move?
*Oof!*  (You hit the wall)
Your colorful comments awaken the wumpus!
Enter a list of rooms to shoot into:
The arrow falls to the ground at your feet.
A faint gleam tells you the arrow has gone through a magic tunnel!
The arrow hit nothing.
Sorry, but the instruction file seems to have disappeared in a\
puff of greasy black smoke! (poof)
*ROAR* *chomp* *snurfle* *chomp*!\
Much to the delight of the Wumpus, you walk right into his mouth,\
making you one of the easiest dinners he's ever had!  For you, however,\
it's a rather unpleasant death.  The only good thing is that it's been\
so long since the evil Wumpus cleaned his teeth that you immediately\
pass out from the stench!
Oh dear.  All the commotion has managed to awaken the evil Wumpus, who\
has chosen to walk into this very room!  Your eyes open wide as they behold\
the great sucker-footed bulk that is the Wumpus
*thwock!* *groan* *crash*\
A horrible roar fills the cave, and you realize, with a smile, that you\
have slain the evil Wumpus and won the game!  You don't want to tarry for\
long, however, because not only is the Wumpus famous, but the stench of\
dead Wumpus is also quite well known--a stench powerful enough to slay the\
mightiest adventurer at a single whiff!!
You turn and look at your quiver, and realize with a sinking feeling\
that you've just shot your last arrow (figuratively, too).  Sensing this\
with its psychic powers, the evil Wumpus rampages through the cave, finds\
you, and with a mighty *ROAR* eats you alive!
*Thwack!*  A sudden piercing feeling informs you that your wild arrow\
has ricocheted back and wedged in your side, causing extreme agony.  The\
evil Wumpus, with its psychic powers, realizes this and immediately rushes\
to your side, not to help, alas, but to EAT YOU!\
(*CHOMP*)
\rThe checksume is wrong!\r
[ERROR] Get host ip failed
\r OTA image checksum error!!!
\r OTA image checksum ok!!!
Without conscious thought you grab for the side of the cave and manage\
to grasp onto a rocky outcrop.  Beneath your feet stretches the limitless\
depths of a bottomless pit!  Rock crumbles beneath your feet!

A broadcast packet repeater. This packet repeater (currently designed for udp packets) will listen
for broadcast packets. When it receives the packets, it will then re-broadcast the packet.
[-i] [--incoming <ifin>]  Defines from which interface broadcasts will be relayed.
[-o] [--outgoing <ifout>] Defines to which interface broadcasts will be relayed.
Log messages and debugging go to syslog as DAEMON.
Interfaces can be specified as regexpressions, ie. ppp[0-9]+
[-l] [--listen x.x.x.x]   Specifies IP of local interface to listen to.
[-T] [--ptimeout msec]     Specifies the maximum timeout for the packet.
[-C] [--connections n]    Limit on number of connections.
Logs and debugging go to syslog as DAEMON.
Command line options will override any default settings and any settings

On Windows, point-to-point IP support (i.e. --dev tun)
is emulated by the TAP-Windows driver.  The major limitation
imposed by this approach is that the --ifconfig local and
remote endpoints must be part of the same 255.255.255.252
subnet.  The following list shows examples of endpoint
pairs which satisfy this requirement.  Only the final
component of the IP address pairs is at issue.
As an example, the following option would be correct:
--ifconfig 10.7.0.5 10.7.0.6 (on host A)
--ifconfig 10.7.0.6 10.7.0.5 (on host B)
because [5,6] is part of the below list.
